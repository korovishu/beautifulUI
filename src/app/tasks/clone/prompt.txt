I want a simplified version of LinkedIn. I want a home page where there are posts to like and comment on, a profile page with name, location, bio, and a photo with an edit button, and a form to type and post a new post. An avatar should be there on the top right of the header with an edit icon it, clicking on which should open a popup to edit the profile. Please build it using Next.js and TypeScript in a single .tsx file.

Title-
Simple Linkedin

Description - 
A simple LinkedIn-inspired app that allows users to post, comment, and like posts, along with a personal page containing basic information and a profile picture.

Commentary - 
I started by creating the page structure using Next.js and Tailwind, then added state management for posts and comments, a modal for editing data and publishing new posts, and support for night and light modes.


rewrite changes - 
The model response had a very rudimentary and outdated interface. While it met some functional requirements, it lacked a modern design, dark mode compatibility, or responsiveness. It felt very bland and unrealistic for an app like LinkedIn. In the redesign, I brought the design up to speed with Tailwind CSS, added more advanced interactions like likes and comments, and made the profile editable, with dark mode compatibility. The entire code is in a .tsx file and TypeScript and covers all of the prompt requirements perfectly.

Justification - 
This response touches on all the aspects that are required. From a functionality perspective, there is a homepage where you have blog posts that you can interact with through liking and commenting, a profile page with name, location, bio, and image, and an edit button that is functional, and a writing form for a new post, all of which are ideal. Regarding how it looks, it is rendered super modern and nice with Tailwind. It has night mode, and the animations and hover are all smooth, unlike the older design, which was super old-school and lacked any modern UI niceties. The code is written in the purest way possible with TypeScript, all in a single .tsx file. Status and interaction management are logical and neat, and the result is a streamlined, efficient version of LinkedIn.
