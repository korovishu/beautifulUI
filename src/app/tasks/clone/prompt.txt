EASY - 
Create a clone of Wikipedia website. 
Clone the article page with mock data and some images. 
Make it with Next.js and Typescript. 
The code should be self-contained in a single .tsx file.

Description - 
This Wikipedia replica faithfully reproduces the exact look, feel, and functionality of the original Wikipedia interface. 
It features authentic styling, responsive design, and interactive elements like collapsible sections, language selection, and appearance controls, providing users with a familiar and seamless browsing experience identical to the real Wikipedia.

Commentary - 
The Wikipedia replica is built as a single-file React component using Next.js, with all styling contained in styled-jsx for portability. 
The component structure includes a responsive sidebar, header with search functionality, and article content with interactive elements, while CSS variables enable theme customization and the useState hook manages interactive features like collapsible sections and appearance settings.

rewrite changes - 
The model response does not build due to issues in the code. 
The rewritten code has been written to replicate the UI of Wikipedia website.
The UI involves a side bar, the main content page as well as the content index.
